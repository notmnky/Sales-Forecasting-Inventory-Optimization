Sales Forecasting &amp; Inventory Optimization: Sales Insights from Reactive to Proactive Forecasting

This project was conducted for internal research to address two main problems:
1. The distributors over-ordering to make up for lost sales during COVID-19
2. Under-cutting of Inventory Supply by HQ based on recent sales

Time Series Analysis was conducted on real data and based on the insights gained, recommendations were made.
